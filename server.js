/**
 * Note: Since this route is a "catch all" that matches every GETrequest, be sure to mount API or other routes before it!

Now the "catch all" route will serve the index.html whenever:

A user types a path into the address bar and presses enter.
The user refreshes the browser.
An "external" link in an email, included on another web page, etc. to the MERN-Stack app is clicked.
For example, if we slack the following link to a friend: https://sei-cafe.herokuapp.com/orders/new. The friend clicks on it, initiating an HTTP request to our server.

However, the /orders/newpart of the URL is supposed to be for the client router - not the server! But there it is, and the server has to deal with it...

The server deals with it by, thanks to the "catch all" route, sending back index.html - which is what we want.

After index.html loads in the browser, the React app's client-side routing will render components based upon the /orders/newpath in the address bar.
